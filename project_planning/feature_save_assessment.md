# Feature: Save and Unify Overall Assessment in Interview Reports

## Current Status

- [x] **Data Model:** The Prisma schema has been updated. The `overallSummary` field has been replaced with `overallAssessment`.
- [x] **Backend:** The `getOverallAssessment` tRPC procedure is fully implemented, tested, and refactored. It now correctly saves the assessment to the database on the first request and retrieves the saved version on subsequent requests.
- [x] **Frontend:** The UI correctly displays the saved assessment. This was verified via E2E testing with Playwright, which is our new standard for frontend feature testing.
- [x] **Overall:** This feature is now considered complete.

## TDD Implementation Steps

All changes for this feature followed the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.

### 1. RED: Write Failing Tests First

#### a. Backend (tRPC) - [x] COMPLETE
- **File:** `tests/server/routers/report.test.ts`
- Wrote unit/integration tests for the `getOverallAssessment` procedure to verify that:
  - [x] An existing `overallAssessment` is returned without calling the LLM.
  - [x] If no assessment exists, it is generated, saved to the database, and then returned.
  - [x] Errors for "session not found" or "unauthorized" are handled correctly.

#### b. Frontend (E2E) - [x] COMPLETE
- **File:** `tests/e2e/report-page.test.ts`
- **Strategy Shift:** We pivoted from Jest/RTL component tests to Playwright E2E tests due to the unreliability and complexity of mocking tRPC hooks in a JSDOM environment.
- Wrote a Playwright E2E test to:
  - [x] Verify that a completed session's report page correctly displays the `overallAssessment` that was seeded into the database by the `globalSetup` script.

### 2. GREEN: Implement Minimal Code to Pass Tests

#### a. Data Model - [x] COMPLETE
- [x] Updated the Prisma schema, replacing `overallSummary` with `overallAssessment` (`Json?`).
- [x] Ran `npx prisma migrate dev --name overall-assessment-json` to apply the changes.

#### b. Backend - [x] COMPLETE
- [x] Updated the `getOverallAssessment` procedure to implement the check/generate/save logic.
- [x] Updated all references from `overallSummary` to `overallAssessment`.

#### c. Frontend - [x] COMPLETE
- [x] Updated the report page and the `OverallAssessment.tsx` component to correctly render the full assessment object from the API.
- [x] Updated tRPC API calls and component prop types to match the new data structure.

### 3. REFACTOR: Clean Up and Optimize

- [x] Refactored backend and frontend code for clarity and maintainability.
- [x] Removed all obsolete code related to the old `overallSummary` field.
- [x] Updated project documentation (`tdd_methodology.md`) to reflect the new Playwright-first testing strategy for the frontend.
- [x] Ensured all tests (backend and E2E) remained green after refactoring.

### 4. Integration Testing - [x] COMPLETE

- [x] Our primary integration test is the Playwright E2E test (`tests/e2e/report-page.test.ts`), which validates the entire flow from the browser, through the Next.js server and tRPC router, to the database, and back.
- [x] The E2E test successfully verified the core user workflow of viewing a completed interview report.

## Final Technical Summary

- **Data Model:** The `overallSummary: String?` field in the `SessionData` model was replaced with `overallAssessment: Json?`.
- **Backend:** The `getOverallAssessment` tRPC procedure in `src/server/api/routers/report.ts` now handles the logic for caching the assessment in the database.
- **Frontend:** The report page at `src/app/(protected)/sessions/[id]/report/` correctly fetches and displays the structured `overallAssessment` object.
- **Testing:** Backend logic is unit-tested in `tests/server/routers/report.test.ts`. The frontend UI and full data pipeline are tested with the E2E test in `tests/e2e/report-page.test.ts`.

## Test Coverage for This Feature

### Backend (tRPC)
- **File:** `tests/server/routers/report.test.ts`
- **Coverage:**
  - Returns saved `overallAssessment` if present (LLM is not called)
  - Generates, saves, and returns assessment if not present
  - Handles session not found and unauthorized access

### Frontend (React)
- **File:** `tests/frontend/app/(protected)/sessions/[id]/report/report-content.test.tsx`
- **Coverage:**
  - Renders assessment summary, strengths, improvements, and score from the API
  - Shows loading spinner
  - Shows error message
  - Handles missing assessment gracefully

---

## 1. Data Model Changes

- **Replace** `overallSummary` (String?) with `overallAssessment` (Json?) in the `SessionData` model.
- **Prisma schema update:**
  ```prisma
  model SessionData {
    // ... other fields ...
    overallAssessment Json?
    // ... other fields ...
  }
  ```
- **Migration:**
  - Run: `npx prisma migrate dev --name overall-assessment-json`
- **Update** all TypeScript types and usages to reference `overallAssessment` instead of `overallSummary`.

---

## 2. Backend Logic Changes

- In `src/server/api/routers/report.ts`:
  - In the `getOverallAssessment` procedure:
    - **Check** if `session.overallAssessment` exists:
      - If **yes**, return it (parse as needed).
      - If **no**, generate it, save it to `overallAssessment`, and return it.
  - **Update** any code that previously used `overallSummary` to use the new field and structure.
- **Update** any other backend code that references or expects `overallSummary`.

---

## 3. Frontend Logic Changes

- In `src/app/(protected)/sessions/[id]/report/report-content.tsx` (and related files):
  - **Update** logic to expect the full assessment object (with summary, strengths, improvements, score) from the API.
  - **Update** any code that previously used `overallSummary` to use the new structure.
  - **Ensure** components like `OverallAssessment` receive the correct props and render all fields (summary, strengths, improvements, score).
- **If** the UI allows "regenerating" the assessment, ensure it updates the stored value.

---

## 4. (Optional) Data Migration

- If existing data in `overallSummary` should be preserved, write a migration script to convert those strings into the new JSON format:
  ```json
  {
    "summary": "...",
    "strengths": [],
    "improvements": [],
    "score": 0
  }
  ```

---

## 5. Testing

- Test creating a new session and viewing the report.
- Test reloading the report to ensure the assessment is loaded from the database, not regenerated.
- Test edge cases (no assessment, corrupted data, etc.).

---

## Field Name Decision
- The unified field will be named: `overallAssessment` (type: `Json?`).
