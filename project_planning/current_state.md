# AI Interview Pro MVP - Current Development State

This document tracks the current progress and detailed tasks for the active development phase.

**⚠️ ARCHITECTURAL CORRECTION NOTICE:**
During Phase 1 development, we discovered a critical architectural mismatch: the planning documents assumed REST API patterns, but the codebase is actually built with **tRPC for type-safe, end-to-end APIs**. All components have been successfully migrated to use tRPC hooks, and planning documents have been corrected.

## Phase 1: Dashboard & Core Data Integration (MVP Specific) - **✅ COMPLETED**

**Goal:** Build the user's main dashboard, allowing them to input JD/Resume text and view basic session history, fully integrated with the tRPC backend procedures developed in MVP Backend Phases 1 & 2.

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

**What Was Accomplished:**

### 1. Frontend Testing Strategy Implementation
- **✅ Abandoned MSW approach** due to compatibility issues with Jest/jsdom (TextEncoder, BroadcastChannel errors)
- **✅ Successfully implemented direct tRPC hook mocking approach** using `jest.mock()` for `~/utils/api` tRPC hooks
- **✅ Created comprehensive test coverage** with 36 passing component tests:
  - Dashboard Page: 5 tests (loading states, tRPC data fetching, error handling, component integration)
  - MvpJdResumeInputForm: 11 tests (form interactions, tRPC mutations, validation, loading states)
  - MvpSessionHistoryList: 13 tests (data display, formatting, user interactions, empty states)
  - All UI Components: Button, Input, Spinner, Timer tests

### 2. Component Implementation  
- **✅ Dashboard Page** (`src/app/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx`): 
  - Orchestrates data fetching using tRPC hooks: `api.jdResume.getJdResumeText.useQuery()` and `api.session.listForCurrentText.useQuery()`
  - Handles loading states with spinners and error boundaries using tRPC's built-in state management
  - Integrates both form and history list components with proper callbacks and refetch capabilities
  
- **✅ MvpJdResumeInputForm** (`src/components/MvpJdResumeInputForm.tsx`):
  - Text areas for job description and resume input with proper labeling
  - Save functionality using `api.jdResume.saveJdResumeText.useMutation()` with loading states and success feedback
  - Session creation using `api.session.createSession.useMutation()` with router navigation
  - Form validation preventing session creation until text is saved
  - Comprehensive error handling for both save and create operations using tRPC mutation callbacks
  
- **✅ MvpSessionHistoryList** (`src/components/MvpSessionHistoryList.tsx`):
  - Loading states with skeleton UI placeholders using tRPC query loading state
  - Empty state messaging ("No interview sessions yet")
  - Session status badges (Completed/In Progress) with proper styling
  - Date formatting and duration calculation
  - Question counting and turn summary
  - Click handlers for navigation to session reports

### 3. tRPC Integration & Backend Implementation
- **✅ Frontend Migration**: Successfully migrated from REST API calls to tRPC hooks:
  - `useGetJdResumeText` - Load existing text on dashboard mount using `api.jdResume.getJdResumeText.useQuery()`
  - `useSaveJdResumeText` - Save form text with loading feedback using `api.jdResume.saveJdResumeText.useMutation()`
  - `useCreateSession` - Start new interview session with navigation using `api.session.createSession.useMutation()`
  - `useListSessionsForCurrentText` - Load session history using `api.session.listForCurrentText.useQuery()`

- **✅ Backend tRPC Procedures**: Implemented missing backend procedures:
  - **jdResumeRouter**: `getJdResumeText` and `saveJdResumeText` procedures (already existed)
  - **sessionRouter**: Added `listForCurrentText` procedure to fetch user's session history filtered by current JD/Resume text
  - **sessionRouter**: `createSession` procedure (already existed)
  - All procedures use `protectedProcedure` with proper authentication and database operations

- **✅ Type Safety**: Full end-to-end type safety from backend procedures to frontend hooks using tRPC's automatic type inference

### 4. User Experience Features
- **✅ Loading States**: Automatic loading indicators using tRPC's `isLoading` state
- **✅ Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages using tRPC's error handling with `onError` callbacks
- **✅ Form Validation**: Prevents actions when data is incomplete
- **✅ Success Feedback**: Visual confirmation using tRPC mutation `onSuccess` callbacks
- **✅ Navigation**: Seamless routing between dashboard and session views
- **✅ Responsive Design**: Modern UI components with proper accessibility
- **✅ Cache Management**: Automatic cache updates and invalidation using tRPC's built-in cache management

### 5. Development Experience Improvements
- **✅ DEV_BYPASS_AUTH**: Added development environment variable to bypass authentication during testing (alongside existing E2E_TESTING bypass)
- **✅ Type Safety**: Eliminated manual API type definitions thanks to tRPC's automatic type inference
- **✅ Automatic State Management**: Loading, error, and success states handled automatically by tRPC hooks

## Testing Summary

**✅ All Phase 1 Tests Passing**: 36/36 component tests successful
- Frontend testing strategy established with tRPC hook mocking approach  
- Real component implementation with comprehensive test coverage using mocked tRPC hooks
- MSW compatibility issues documented and tRPC hook mocking approach proven effective

**⚠️ One Unrelated Test Issue**: `tests/frontend/app/page.test.tsx` failing due to Jest/ESM configuration with `next-auth` (not blocking Phase 1 completion)

## Documentation Updates

**✅ Planning Documents Corrected**: Updated both `frontend_plan.md` and `frontend_tdd.md` to reflect actual tRPC architecture:
- Replaced REST API patterns with tRPC hook patterns
- Updated testing strategies from MSW to tRPC hook mocking
- Corrected all code examples to use tRPC hooks instead of fetch calls
- Added architectural correction notices to prevent future confusion

## What's Next

**Phase 2 Options** (to be prioritized):

### Option A: Session Interview Experience
Implement the core interview session page (`/sessions/[id]`) where users:
- View questions and provide answers using tRPC procedures
- Experience real-time AI interaction through tRPC streaming (if implemented)
- Track progress through the interview
- Complete sessions with feedback

### Option B: Session Reports & History  
Build session report views (`/sessions/[id]/report`) where users:
- Review completed interview sessions using tRPC data fetching
- See questions, answers, and AI feedback
- View performance summaries and insights
- Access historical interview data

### Option C: Enhanced Dashboard Features
Extend the current dashboard with tRPC-powered features:
- Session analytics and performance tracking
- Multiple job description/resume combinations
- Session scheduling and management
- Export/sharing capabilities with optimistic updates

**Recommendation**: Proceed with **Option A: Session Interview Experience** as it completes the core user flow from dashboard → interview → results, providing a complete end-to-end MVP experience using the established tRPC patterns.

4. **Testing Patterns**: Established reliable frontend testing patterns using tRPC hook mocking that can be applied to all future components
5. **User Experience**: Implemented modern UI patterns with accessibility, responsive design, and automatic state management
6. **Backend Integration**: Successfully connected frontend to backend through properly implemented tRPC procedures with authentication
7. **Architecture Alignment**: Corrected planning documents to match actual codebase architecture, preventing future development confusion
