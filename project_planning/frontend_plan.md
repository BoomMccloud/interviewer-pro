# AI Interview Pro MVP - Frontend Development Plan

This document outlines the complete frontend development plan for the AI Interview Pro MVP, prioritizing core infrastructure and iterative integration with the backend tRPC APIs to deliver a robust interview preparation platform.

**‚ö†Ô∏è ARCHITECTURAL CORRECTION NOTICE:**
This document was originally written assuming REST API patterns, but the codebase is actually built with **tRPC for type-safe, end-to-end APIs**. All patterns have been corrected to reflect the tRPC architecture that is implemented in the codebase.

**Overall Project Vision:**
Build a complete interview preparation platform where users can input job descriptions and resumes, conduct AI-powered mock interviews, and receive detailed performance reports with actionable feedback.
