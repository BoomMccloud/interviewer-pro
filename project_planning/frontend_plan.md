# AI Interview Pro MVP - Frontend Development Plan

This document outlines the complete frontend development plan for the AI Interview Pro MVP, prioritizing core infrastructure and iterative integration with the backend tRPC APIs to deliver a robust interview preparation platform.

**‚ö†Ô∏è ARCHITECTURAL CORRECTION NOTICE:**
This document was originally written assuming REST API patterns, but the codebase is actually built with **tRPC for type-safe, end-to-end APIs**. All patterns have been corrected to reflect the tRPC architecture that is implemented in the codebase.

**Overall Project Vision:**
Build a complete interview preparation platform where users can input job descriptions and resumes, conduct AI-powered mock interviews, and receive detailed performance reports with actionable feedback.

## Phase 0: Foundation - Styling, Authentication Infrastructure, tRPC Pattern ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

**Goal:** Establish the core technical plumbing for visual consistency, security, and reliable backend communication using tRPC.

**What Was Accomplished:**
- ‚úÖ **Styling Setup:** Tailwind CSS configuration, global styles, core UI component library (`Button`, `Input`, `Spinner`, `Timer`)
- ‚úÖ **Authentication Infrastructure:** NextAuth configuration, protected routes, login/logout flow, middleware for route protection
- ‚úÖ **tRPC Integration:** Type-safe API communication, automatic loading states, error handling, client-side hooks

**Impact:** Provides the foundation for all subsequent development with consistent styling, secure authentication, and type-safe backend communication.

## Phase 1: Dashboard & Core Data Integration ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

**Goal:** Build the user's main dashboard for inputting JD/Resume text and viewing session history, fully integrated with tRPC backend procedures.

**What Was Accomplished:**
- ‚úÖ **Dashboard Page:** Central user interface orchestrating form and history components
- ‚úÖ **JD/Resume Input Form:** Text input with save functionality and session creation
- ‚úÖ **Session History List:** Display of past interview sessions with navigation
- ‚úÖ **tRPC Integration:** Full integration with backend procedures for data persistence and retrieval
- ‚úÖ **Testing Foundation:** 36 passing component tests with tRPC hook mocking patterns

**Impact:** Users can now input their job information, save it, start interview sessions, and view their interview history. Complete end-to-end data flow established.

## Phase 2: Session Reports & History ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

**Goal:** Build comprehensive session report views that enable users to review completed interviews, analyze performance, and receive AI-generated feedback for improvement.

**What Was Accomplished:**
- ‚úÖ **Session Report Pages:** Detailed view of completed interview sessions at `/sessions/[id]/report`
- ‚úÖ **Performance Analytics:** Visual metrics, timing analysis, and progress tracking with performance scoring
- ‚úÖ **AI-Generated Feedback:** Strengths, weaknesses, and improvement recommendations with skill assessment
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Navigation:** Seamless flow from session history to detailed reports with enhanced UI
- ‚úÖ **Export/Sharing UI:** Interface implemented with placeholder functionality for future backend integration

**Backend Integration Completed:**
- ‚úÖ **tRPC Procedures:** `getSessionReport`, `getSessionAnalytics`, `getSessionFeedback` fully implemented
- ‚úÖ **Analytics Engine:** Response time calculations, performance scoring algorithms, progress tracking
- ‚úÖ **Data Processing:** Session history parsing, metrics calculation, feedback generation

**Frontend Components Completed:**
- ‚úÖ **Report Page:** Main session analysis interface with tRPC integration
- ‚úÖ **Component Suite:** SessionOverview, SessionTimeline, SessionAnalytics, SessionFeedback (all 4 implemented)
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Navigation:** Updated dashboard and session history with "View Report" links

**Impact:** Users can now gain deep insights into their interview performance, understand areas for improvement, and track progress over time. Transforms raw session data into actionable intelligence with comprehensive analytics and AI-powered feedback.

**Status:** *Fully functional session report system ready for production use.*
