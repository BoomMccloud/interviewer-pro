# Database Schema Migration Plan
## Code Alignment to QuestionSegments Structure

**Migration Date**: June 4, 2025
**Goal**: Align all tRPC procedures and frontend code with the existing `questionSegments` + `currentQuestionIndex` database structure using Test-Driven Development.

**🎯 TDD APPROACH**: Following established RED-GREEN-REFACTOR methodology to ensure robust, tested migration with backend procedures, frontend components, and end-to-end integration.

**🎉 CURRENT STATUS: MIGRATION 95%+ COMPLETE ✅**

  personaId            String
  startTime            DateTime     @default(now())
  endTime              DateTime?
  durationInSeconds    Int
  questionSegments     Json         // ✅ Array of QuestionSegment objects
  currentQuestionIndex Int          @default(0)  // ✅ Currently active question
  overallSummary       String?
  createdAt            DateTime     @default(now())
  updatedAt            DateTime     @updatedAt
  userId               String
  jdResumeTextId       String
  // ... relations
}
```

### **QuestionSegment Interface (IMPLEMENTED & WORKING)**
```typescript
interface QuestionSegment {
  questionId: string;           // "q1_opening", "q2_topic1", "q3_behavioral"
  questionNumber: number;       // 1, 2, 3...
  questionType: string;         // "opening", "technical", "behavioral"
  question: string;             // The actual question text
  keyPoints: string[];          // Array of guidance points
  startTime: string;            // ISO timestamp when question started
  endTime: string | null;       // ISO timestamp when completed, null if active
  conversation: Array<{         // Chat history for this specific question
    role: "ai" | "user";
    content: string;
    timestamp: string;
    messageType: "question" | "response";
  }>;
}
