#Follow These Instructions
## Follow our TDD methodology when creating new features
## Keep files to less than 300 rows, files should be modular and with single functionality
## Start with backend features first, once they pass, start working on the frontend
## For each file you generate, write a summary at the top of the file that describes what the file does and key functions.
## If lint errors persist, as the user to run `npm run lint` in terminal to see what the output is
