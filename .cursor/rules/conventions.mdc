#Follow These Instructions
## Confirm with the user before generating any code
## For each file you generate, write a summary at the top of the file that describes what the file does and key functions.
## If lint errors persist, as the user to run `npm run lint` in terminal to see what the output is
## Only edit files that are related to the current task, if there is a lint error in an unrelated file, ignore it for now.
