- For each file you generate, write a summary at the top of the file that describes what the file does and key functions.
- If lint errors persist, as the user to run `npm run lint` in terminal to see what the output is
- Correct Prisma Model Names (as defined in prisma/schema.prisma):
** SessionData: Used for storing session-specific information.
** JdResumeText: Used for storing job description and resume text.
** User: Represents users of the application.
** Note: MvpSessionTurn is an interface you've defined to structure the objects within the SessionData.history JSON field. It is not a direct Prisma model.
** Note: Persona is not a Prisma model. It's a concept likely represented by a plain object, and SessionData stores a personaId (string) to link to it.
- Prisma Client Instance Export/Import:
** Export: The Prisma Client instance is initialized and exported from src/server/db.ts using a named export, typically as db.
** Example in src/server/db.ts: export const db = new PrismaClient();
** Import: When you need to use the Prisma client in other files (e.g., API routes, test files), you import the named export.
** Example import: import { db } from '~/server/db'; (assuming ~/* is aliased to src/*).
